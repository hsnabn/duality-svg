# DualitySVG
This is an editor plugin providing SVG import support for the Duality game engine.
The project requires the SVG.NET library to compile (https://github.com/vvvv/SVG).

This project is still in very, very early stages. It is not very featured, and may or may not have the occasional bug or two.
File an issue if you do find a bug.
